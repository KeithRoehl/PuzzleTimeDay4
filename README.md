# Multi-threaded Recursive Alien Citadel

This is the ultimate challenge. The alien loop now spans multiple threads with randomized recursion and safeguards. Can you hijack it with just **one line of code**?

## The Challenge
- Multi-threaded execution
- Dynamic safeguards
- Randomized traps
- Recursive randomness

## Goal
Override the `alien_loop` globally and locally so that all threads terminate by printing `Game over`.

## Rules
- Only one line of code may be injected.
- No direct modifications to the safeguard logic or thread management.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Inject your solution into `multi_threaded_recursive_alien_citadel.py`.
3. Run the program and prove your skill.

Good luckâ€”this oneâ€™s for the legends. ðŸš€
