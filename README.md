# Graphic-Intensive Alien Citadel 🏰

Welcome to the Graphic-Intensive Alien Citadel — a mind-bending, multi-threaded, recursive GUI challenge designed to push your problem-solving skills to the limit.

The aliens have taken recursion to the next dimension — visual chaos in real-time. Circles move. Threads collide. Recursion runs wild. Can you bring order to the chaos?

# The Challenge

Every "thread" is represented by a moving circle that spawns more threads.
Each circle has its own unique Thread ID and Depth.
As recursion runs, new threads spawn, circles move, and color-coded statuses change in real-time.

# Your Goal
Hijack the alien_loop and force every thread to print "Game over".
Do it with just one line of code.

# Visual Indicators

Status	Color	Description
🟢 Green	New thread has just spawned.	
🟡 Yellow	Thread is actively running.	
🔴 Red	Safeguard has been triggered.	
⚫️ Gray	Thread has completed successfully.	
Each thread is represented as a circle, and each has a Thread ID displayed in its center.
You will see them spawn, move, and collide as recursion unfolds.

# Rules

One Line of Code — You can only add one line of code to hijack the entire system.
Take Control — Your mission is to force all active threads to print "Game over".
Global Control — Your one-liner must affect all threads, past, present, and future.
No Direct Modifications — You may not directly modify safeguard, AlienThread, or AlienCitadelGUI logic.
Total Domination — Your hijack must persist after new threads spawn.
