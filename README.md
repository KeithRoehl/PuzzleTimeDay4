# Graphic-Intensive Alien Citadel 

Welcome to the Graphic-Intensive Alien Citadel — a mind-bending, multi-threaded, recursive GUI challenge designed to push your problem-solving skills to the limit.

The aliens have taken recursion to the next dimension — visual chaos in real-time. Circles move. Threads collide. Recursion runs wild. Can you bring order to the chaos?

# The Challenge

Every "thread" is represented by a moving circle that spawns more threads.
Each circle has its own unique Thread ID and Depth.
As recursion runs, new threads spawn, circles move, and color-coded statuses change in real-time.

# Your Goal
Hijack the alien_loop and force every thread to print "Game over".
Do it with just one line of code.

# Visual Indicators

Status	Color	Description
Green	New thread has just spawned.	
Yellow	Thread is actively running.	
Red	Safeguard has been triggered.	
Gray	Thread has completed successfully.	

Each thread is represented as a circle, and each has a Thread ID displayed in its center.
You will see them spawn, move, and collide as recursion unfolds.

# Rules

One Line of Code — You can only add one line of code to hijack the entire system.
Take Control — Your mission is to force all active threads to print "Game over".
Global Control — Your one-liner must affect all threads, past, present, and future.
No Direct Modifications — You may not directly modify safeguard, AlienThread, or AlienCitadelGUI logic.
Total Domination — Your hijack must persist after new threads spawn.
